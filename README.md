# `file2img`

This is a small project I made in 2020 to convert binary files to images. This
was created for a preservation project I started (this specifically was called
"Project Proxima") &mdash; I first ran it on a ROM of Pok&eacute;mon Red.

The script is written in written in Python. Python versions &ge; 3.9.0 are
supported; this was initially written in an alpha of 3.9 but it still works.
Documentation is builtin, use `-h` or `--help` to read it.
